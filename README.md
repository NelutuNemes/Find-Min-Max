# Min/Max Number Checker

This repository contains three files:

1. `index.html`
2. `style.css`
3. `script.js`

## Description

The `index.html` file represents a simple HTML document with an input field to enter numbers separated by commas and two buttons: one to check the minimum and maximum numbers entered and another one to reset the input field and results.

The `style.css` file contains styling rules for the HTML elements to provide a visually appealing layout.

The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code to handle user input, calculate the minimum and maximum numbers, and update the display accordingly.

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter some numbers between 0 and 100 separated by commas in the input field.
3. Press the "Check Min/Max" button to calculate and display the minimum and maximum numbers.
4. To reset the input field and results, click the "Reset" button.

## Functionality

- The JavaScript code ensures that the minimum and maximum numbers are calculated correctly from the user input.
- Input validation is performed to ensure that the user enters valid numbers before calculations.
- Error messages are displayed if invalid input is provided, and they disappear after 1.5 seconds.

## Notes:

Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Min/Max Number Checker App.
